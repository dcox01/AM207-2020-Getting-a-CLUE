This notebook presents the paper 'Getting a CLUE: A Method for Explaining Uncertainty'. We highlight the salient contents of the paper and provide implementations for the key algorithms and models. Next, we perform experiments with the models and evaluate their performance on several datasets (both synthetic and real). We provide an evaluation of th authors approach and discuss the overall significance and broader impact of the paper.
