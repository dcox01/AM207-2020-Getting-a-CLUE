In the main notebook in this repository "AM207Report.ipynb" which we recreate and explore much of the work from the following recent paper.

A. Javier et al. 'Getting a CLUE: A Method for Explaining Uncertainty Estimates'
arXiv:2006.06848v1by 2020

We highlight the salient contents of the paper and provide implementations for the key algorithms and models. We then perform experiments with the models and evaluate their performance on several datasets (both synthetic and real). We provide an evaluation of the authors' approach and discuss the overall significance and broader impact of the paper.
